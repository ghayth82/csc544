\bs{$PSPACE$}
\fdef{{\bf $PSPACE$} is the class of languages that are decidable in polynomial space on a deterministic Turing machine.  Formally,
\[
PSPACE = \bigcup_k SPACE(n^k), \mbox{ with $k > 0$}.
\]
}

We define $NPSPACE = \bigcup_k NSPACE(n^k)$, for $k > 0$.  But from Savitch's theorem it follows that
{\small
\[
NPSPACE = \bigcup_k NSPACE(n^k) = \bigcup_k SPACE(n^{k+2}) = \bigcup_k SPACE(n^k) = PSPACE.
\]
}

\bs{A Hierarchy of Complexity}

We can now construct a hierarchy of complexity classes.

Observe that $P \subseteq PSPACE$.  To see this let a machine execute in $t(n) \ge n$ polynomial time.  But this implies that the machine can use at most $t(n)$ polynomial space (one cell per computation step).

In a similar argument we have $NP \subseteq NPSPACE$ and from the argument above $NP \subseteq PSPACE$.

We already know that $P \subseteq NP$.

Finally, if we have a $f(n) \ge n$ polynomial space machine it can be shown that this machine runs in
$2^{O(f(n))}$ exponential time.  Thus, $PSPACE \subseteq EXPTIME$.

\[
P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE \subseteq EXPTIME.\footnote{It is believed that all the set containments are proper.}
\]
